# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

We used a data-driven approach for sub-phenotyping of patients admitted for thrombotic events. For this project, we used exploratory data analysis and natural language processing methods to help extract patients' features identified by thrombotic events. We have used ICD9 codes to describe our subcohort of thrombotic events from MIMIC-III. We will examine the patterns seen in the two cohorts of thrombotic and bleeding. This project uses the publicly available MIMIC-III ICU dataset to study the characteristics of the patients admitted to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center under the category of Thrombotic events. This dataset has been developed by MIT and published around over 60,000 intensive care unit hospitalizations. This dataset includes demographics, vital signs, laboratory tests, medications, and other structured and unstructured data.
